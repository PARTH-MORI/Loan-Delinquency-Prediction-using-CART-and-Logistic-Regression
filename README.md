# Loan-Delinquency-Prediction-using-CART-and-Logistic-Regression
The objective of this project is to develop predictive models to accurately classify and predict loan delinquencies using CART (Decision Tree) and Logistic Regression. By identifying potentially delinquent loans, financial institutions can better manage risk and make informed decisions to mitigate potential losses.
