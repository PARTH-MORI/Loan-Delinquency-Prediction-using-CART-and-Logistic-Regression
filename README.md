# Loan-Delinquency-Prediction-using-CART-and-Logistic-Regression
  The objective of this project is to develop predictive models to accurately classify and predict loan delinquencies using CART (Decision Tree) and Logistic Regression. By identifying potentially delinquent loans,   financial institutions can better manage risk and make informed decisions to mitigate potential losses.

## Data Loading and Preparation:
  Loaded loan delinquency data.
  Performed data cleaning and preprocessing.
  Created dummy variables for categorical features.
  Split the data into training and testing sets.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and relationships within the data.

## Model Building and Evaluation:
  **Decision Tree Classifier:**
      Initialized and trained a Decision Tree Classifier.
      Evaluated the model using appropriate metrics.
  **Logistic Regression:**
      Trained a Logistic Regression model.
      Predicted outcomes on training and testing data.
      Evaluated model performance with classification reports.

**Tools and Technologies:**
  "Utilized Python and libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn for data manipulation and model building."
  "Visualized data and model outcomes using matplotlib and seaborn."

**Project Outcomes:**
  "Successfully built a predictive model to classify loan delinquencies, contributing to more accurate risk assessment."
